Define an individual default post date that is to be used when adding a new post.

== Description ==

**Define an individual default post date that is to be used when adding a new post.**

Have you ever had to create a fair amount of posts that all should be published on an individual date other than today?

Maybe some reviews of an event a while back? Or a bunch of essays scheduled for the day after tomorrow?

This is exactly when _Default Post Date_ kicks in.
